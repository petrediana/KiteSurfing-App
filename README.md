# KiteSurfing-App

### Short introduction:

An android project that I took as part of a company challenge a few months ago. Initially I had to keep this project private, but since the challange is over I can finally post it.

The app ideea is simple, it introduces you to new areas of programming which are working with REST APIS, using the retrofit library, using POSTMAN to test the server requests/output.

### Here is a short introduction to what the application does:
  1) You need to log in with an account
  2) Using internet access, you can connect to a server and receive data about Kitesurfing spots that are available
  3) You can tap on any spot to see different details about it, add/remove it from favourites
  4) You can filter the spots by their country or wind probability
  5) Enjoy the challange and the app :)
